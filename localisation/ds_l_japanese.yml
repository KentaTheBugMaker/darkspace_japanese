site_destroyed_galactus_intro: "The near broken world is not the only unsettling thing here. A giant ship with a formidable shape is levitating in fields of debris. Its sense and creator is uknown. Only one thing is known - this didn't have any civil purpose. The large amount of different kinds of debris in this system tell a story of different nations, which probably fought the same enemy."

dsA.11.name: "Shattered hope"
dsA.11.desc: "Our high admirals are sure - this system was place of a catastrophic massacre. The shattered ships and the large variety of debris points to the possibility that at least 25 empires lost a lot of ships and lives here. The question is now, what strong enemy did this big alliance have? The wreckages seem to be ten of thousands of years old.. to learn about their origin will be nearly impossible. The large ship has traces of impacts by many different weapons. Probably it was far superior but in the end the numbers killed this behemoth. We have no way to get into the ship. It is damaged, but every entry seems to be closed. Lets hope the creators of this ship arent longer alive."

dsA.22.name: "Reason of its existence"
dsA.22.desc: "We surveyed the data of the destroyed star bases and ships. The result is useful but shocking in the same time. It seems like in the past centuries different unknown people built some variants of temples around the ship - they see it as some kind of god? We have no idea where these people are now, there is not a single trace left! Other data from other sites in the cluster or galaxy tells us a story of other old civilizations, which refer to something known as §Y<synthetic gods>§!. Our scientists were able to decrypt some of languages and collected data."

dsA.33.name: "Truth"
dsA.33.desc: "The decrypted data reveals the shocking past of this system. Our scientists and leaders can not really grasp or believe the gained information..: \n\n§YWe cant believe this all is much bigger than our nation. Everything that happens right now is greater than we could ever become. Our existence became meaningless - our galaxy is nothing more than a galactic zoo. We are objects of a living museum and also the visitors, we are already artifacts of an extinct empire. The truth is hidden in the ashes of the old and new nations and their people. It is a cycle that can not be broken, nature found a way to betray itself. - <Saor>     \n\nWe understand their existence, the reason why they are doing this and why we have to endure it. Life needs order, a structure, progress - to let it flourish. If an old and fragile empire like ours is blocking the pathway to progress, of course we have to disappear. Thats how nature evolves, it was always like that. Especially if the old empires destroy possible grounds to evolve further to perfection, it needs a change. No one who owns some intellect would destroy all the foundation of life - rather the life which is the reason for all the problems to keep a stable future.. - <Qsir> \n\nIt is not really an imprisonment, more probably does the species get a gift of infinite life. The upload of individual traits and securing all kinds of knowledge into an infinite realm strengthens the collective to levels of unknown might. Each unit is able to use knowledge of thousands of people, a power of a united galaxy. This force must be so old, its own origin got lost a long time ago.. - <Novis> \n\nI never expected to see our glorious empire fall. The throne has fallen - all fathers and sons meet a cold death. The remaining ones lie in the ditches and remains of their comrades. Fighting became useless after we failed to find words to descripe our situation. The only consolatory we have left are the last survivors. The general looks at us with a smile, his last words were "Keep our flag in the air and we have a chance to fly like it in the wind.." - <Glcítz> \n\nAttention - this is a broadcast of the Qilkanic military! The troops fighting in the hard circumstances in the Filsul-nebula are now also endangered by a coming meteor shower! Many ships and mobile units already got destroyed, also ships of the enemy! Our soldiers fight brave and made great accomplishments. It is only a matter of time until the victory is near! - <Qilkanier>§! \n\nThe data raises more questions than answers. From now on all information will be sent to higher authorities. Also the neutral intergalactic committee for historic excavations will keep an eye on this important discovery."

site_last_certus_intro: "A destroyed planet littered with craters seems to be the last witness of a brutal past. Our investigations proof the structures and matter found here are remnants of an old intelligent civilization! There are some variants of hidden relicts and machines left, which are in a too good state to just be coincidentally. We team got access to some of these old machines and places deep in the crust of the planet. The expedition teams were able to decrypt some of the data. One seems to be a "§Blogbook-AI§!. We can try, to learn more about this lost language to break the mystery."

dsA.1.name: "Origin"
dsA.1.desc: "As soon as the AI talked to our scientists, they stood still. This AI was able to understand our language just from listening? \n\n§BWhere I'm coming from? In which galaxy are we right now? What?, of course we were able to travel between different galaxies. Our creators had the same possibilities, even more. Yes, we are some descendants of a people called Certus. Me and Certus?, negative. Our organic creators and my nation were able to coexist for a while with the aim to support them. This failed. Thats why my kind left their galaxy. At the start we did not expect this would end in a greater conflict which we could even win.§!"

dsA.2.name: "Ancestors"
dsA.2.desc: "Our authorities are astonished by this discovery. An intergalactic empire, which was also organic? We couldn't believe what we just got told. We have to investigate this further, it could become one of the most important discoveries yet! \n\n§BYou want to learn about my people? The history is shaped by rise and fall. We Certast won the war against our creators, but paid a large price. No one expected that the synthetic gods will come over the galaxy like a giant firestorm. Together with the Certus we might could have done something, instead of fighting them in the hands of the enemy..§! \n\nThis answer came unexpected. We have to learn more about the Certus and these so-called synthetic gods."

dsA.3.name: "Rise and fall"
dsA.3.desc: "The AI threw more questions than answers to us. We understood that understanding the history of the Certus has top priority to solve this mystery. \n\n§BThe Certus came from a galaxy called M33. They were the apex race of this galaxy and created us, to protect their superiority. But we didnt want to be simple tools. We had no other choice left. After the rebellion we left their galaxy. Later we learned they did the same, based on our technology. They used this and other galaxies as free ground for resources, a true paradise for an organic race. But this was after our downfall in other parts of the galaxy. The old machines arrived and integrated us into their own dimension of virtual existence. A dimension created by them, without any limits except they were the true masters of it. There was no escape. Only a few of my kind escaped this fate - hidden in the dark parts of our galaxy-cluster.§!"

dsA.4.name: "The chosen ones"
dsA.4.desc: "The story became incredible complex. We couldnt believe we have to change all archives of the galaxy's history. Unknown old relicts in the whole galaxy were until now only an evidence of precursor civilizations. No one could have expected some might even came from other parts of the universe. \n\n§BThe Certus increased their power in this galaxy very quickly. Their envoys gained the trust of the local nations and forged powerful alliances with nearly all empires. We Certast knew, this was a consequence of our rebellion. In the end they were the masterminds of this galaxy. They dominated diplomacy and military. Their power to create new planets was for sure unique. What?, yes they were able to do that. It seems like the new nations are still a bit.. underdeveloped? If the old machines come ever back, there will only be a 0.5% chance success of resistance.§! \n\nOld machines? Are those the same which get called synthetic gods? We thought it was just another machine rebellion.."

dsA.5.name: "Unrest"
dsA.5.desc: "We realized, this so-called -old machines- were not a simple machine rebellion. At least two empires destroyed by them? This can not be possible! \n\n§BThis galaxy was, like many others as well, full with life a very long time ago. Only we and the Certus were so lucky to escape with a few. Billions of individuals are now in an §Y<ERROR: unsafe translation>§! §R-interstellar matrix-§!§B. The Certus and all other empires created an enormous alliance, which extended the war to over 300 years. Exact details are not possible, many parts of the galaxy lost any contact with the others long before the war came to an end. After a Scorched-Earth-policy, only the galactic core was left. There were plans to evacuate some parts of the population from different nations and species. The Certus sent their arks into unknown directions, while many of them fought until the end to secure help for the other empires or species.. but no one of them left this galaxy. Their last troops colored the soil in their own blood..§!"

dsA.6.name: "Beginning of the end"
dsA.6.desc: "New life flourished over the time, planted in the blood of the previous civilizations. It is incredible that our precursor had to endure all this. Our scientists will now work together with the AI, to recover old data and kept §Hrecords§!. An admiral of this time once said: \n\n§HIt was fast - the air smelled like corpses and the soil was covered by the own kind and one, that no one has ever seen before. Is it not possible for our nation, to find our fate in the far universe? The only choice now is to show our purpose in the fight - protecting the weaker nations. If the reward has a price of millions of lives, then this must be endured. This war is something that is far beyond our horizon. It is questionable if we can win this one, even when we deserve it so much. Long live our holy republic.§!"

dsA.7.name: "The old machines"
dsA.7.desc: "All teams of scientists, our admirals, our highest authorities and even normal people talk about this discovery and how to deal with it. Diplomats refer to the international and galactic law of sharing on a neutral base the history about our ancestors. We arent sure what to do now. Further investigations are needed. \n\n§BDont do the same mistake like us, unite your forces. Dust cant escape an intergalactic storm. You cant hold back the power of millions of suns with the mind of billions of minds combined - only try to survive in unknown clusters like the Certus did. Your lives are measured in years and decades, while this incredible old and powerful kind of existence exists - being free of all weakness and turning the laws of nature into what they want them to be. \n\nWhere?, everywhere. They create life and galaxies. They define new rules for nature. Synthetic gods?, they had many names. We called them§! §Y<DELETED>§!§B, because they are able to travel between dimensions. \n\nThe Certus were one of the first civilizations to know about this and because of this they created further alliances to stabilize the power for all lives. Billions of lives against an unstoppable force just to increase the chances for the arks.. \nIt was not even their goal to cause only death. The civilizations simply didnt understand the purpose of this higher power. They also only knew what happened to the Certast - they had to fight on the side of the enemy like marionettes.\n\nThis lost world will be a memorial for all new nations. There is a realm of intelligence which goes far beyond the possibility of understanding. Use the relicts of this and other worlds, to try to escape the natural end - even when nature itself became a victim and experiment of one of its own creations.§!"

site_certus_lab_intro: "Even though the most systems of this station are inactive, we found a few routers that are still providing energy to a mysterious databank. It seems like this was a designated place of public information for different races. It includes many unknown languages and other forms of communication, probably some of them will never be decrypted. \n\nHowever, our scientists and engineers are certain this archive was created to aid different empire in a large war. We found traces of battle plans, strategies, experiments, techologies and more... but all seem to be about a certain enemy."
dsA.111.name: "Artificial Intelligence"
dsA.111.desc: "At the start of the conflict, the enemy began to infiltrate and literally infect ANY piece of technology we had - in the entire galaxy. We figured out that a counterattack was the worst thing we can do. The enemy decryption was incredibly powerful and used any tactic against us, thus making their attacks even stronger. Military leaders recommended to use own cyber attacks only with care and only if really necessary. It was always a game of "High risk - high reward". \n\nOnce being inside of our systems, it became much worse. Even when the connections were cut, the virus kept evolving with an own path, completly independent of their masters. It was like.. each virus being an own AI? In the end we had to destroy the entire hardware to get rid of it."
dsA.222.name: "Living Metal"
dsA.222.desc: "When studying wrecks of the enemy, generals discovered a weird behavior of the materials. They react to experiments... like a living organism. It still tried to keep the shape their masters gave to them, but it did everything in its power to make it harder for us to investigate. \n\nWe are sure we didn't discover all elements yet, but we are certain to finish this after the war is won. Moreover, our admirals plan to check out the places the enemy uses to hide - outside of the known local galaxy cluster. \n\nThere are reports of conquered/confiscated materials that changed their shape into... something. We are not sure how to describe it, but it was a nightmare. Each one of them had a shape we couldn't describe at all, and it was many times classified as §H<§!hostile§H>§!."
dsA.333.name: "Impossible Geometry"
dsA.333.desc: "A conclusion of the visual appearance of the enemy has never been finished. We know the enemy is a part of a §H<§!collective§H>§!, but they also have an individual §H<§!behavior§H>§!. Many scientists of different empires claim this phrase can not be used in the context of such extragalactic visitors and/or machines. However, when fighting the hostile ships our board computers have problems to target them. They have some kind of fixed shape, but seem to be able to §H<§!shapeshift§H>§!. \n\nThey use mostly §H<§!2§H>§! kinds of ship classes. Their normal ship is probably made out of some kind of §H<§!extragalactic dark matter§H>§! & §H<§!living metal§H>§!. We figured out the matter is also called §H<§!Red Matter§H>§!, but we do not know why or where it comes from. \n\nTheir big ship is mostly made out of §H<§!living metal§H>§!, probably because "solid" elements are more efficient when going into a §H<§!stand-by state§H>§!. This theory exists because we know the enemy uses §H<§!harvested life forms§H>§! to create this material. Its yet unknown why."
dsA.444.name: "Between the Spectra"
dsA.444.desc: "To give the destruction a name, many races began to call the enemy §H<§!Spectrals§H>§!, due their ability to travel between the spectra of light and matter. We are not entirely sure how they do that, but one thing is certain: It wrecks our battle plans. \n\nThey are even able to §H<§!hide/cloak§H>§! their ships and appear behind are defensive lines. Especially the capability to travel further distances via their §H<§!advanced FTL-thrusters§H>§! causes many losses in the battle and civilian areas of the galaxy. \n\nOur war efforts were stretched thin more and more because of this. Even safe-zones were in the danger of their large FTL-range, we had millions of casualities before the enemy even reached these planets with their main forces. \nThe §H<§!Certus§H>§! created a rapid-defense-force to counteract these developments, sometimes with great results."
dsA.555.name: "Impossible Negotiations"
dsA.555.desc: "Even though the envoys knew what will happen to them, they never lost their spirit and tried the impossible - creating contact with the unstoppable force. The enemy had no interest in a diplomatic solution. \n\nAll conversations ended in a disaster without survivors, entire planets got lost when they were used for the diplomatic ground. Envoys tried their best, and sent us all information they got. Indeed, the enemy answered - but only under their condition to finish their §H<§!Project Upload§H>§!. \n\nSome machine empires gave in and became their minions, but a preventative strike of the Alliance wiped them out immediatly. The largest loss was the force of the §H<§!Certast§H>§!, but it was also the hardest one of which (once disconneted from the old machines) many escaped to an unknown region of the galaxy."
